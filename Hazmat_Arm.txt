Intake / Place
	Hatch (I/P)
	Cargo (just place) - two seat motors on the same shaft to pivot - both 
	have encoders



Suction to grab cargo and hatches
	Solenoid to direct vacuum to cargo
	Solenoid to direct vacuum to hatch

	Step 1: Super Suction Arm (SSA)
	2 seat motors with encoders cause the arm to pivot up & down 
	to position placement of the hatch / cargo the solenoid will direct 
	the vacuum to 3 suction cups for the hatch or 1 large
	suction cup for the cargo.

	starting position:
		intake arm folded in, on top of that (starting)
	intake clearing position

	loading positions: 2
		cargo
		hatch
	unloading positions: 4
		cargo 1
		cargo 2
		hatch 1
		hatch 2

	NOTE: Cargo/hatch 3 will be achieved after elevator


	step 2
		inputs: 
			joystick/buttons from controller 
				4 buttons 
				2 for arm to move up/down
				2 for Solenoid, one for hatch, one for Cargo
				Joystick for emergency manual jog
				
			encoders
				say exact position needed for arm
		outputs: the arm moves up or down to set positions, jog to positions,
		vacuums to load/unload hatch and unload cargo

			use arm at hatchEncoderCount1 during sandstorm to place hatch
			arm used during teleop to load and unload hatch and to load and unload cargo
				loads cargo after gathered by intake arm
