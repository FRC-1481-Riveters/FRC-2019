To do:

Alpha bot:
    1. Wire Vacuum pumps
    2. Plumb Vacuum pumps
    3. Wire Vacuum release valve
    4. Plumb vacuum release valve
    5. Limit switches on Cargo arm
    6. Limit switch on Hazmat arm
    7. Limit switches on Climb Jacks
    8. Add driver camera
    9. Add PEP camera


Beta bot:
    1. x Wire Vacuum pumps
    2. x Plumb Vacuum pumps
    3. x Wire Vacuum release valve
    4. x Plumb vacuum release valve
    5. Limit switches on Cargo arm
    6. Limit switch on Hazmat arm
    7. Limit switches on Climb Jacks
    8. Add driver camera
    9. Add PEP camera


Software to write / test
    1. No crash for Hazmat arm coming down into cargo arm (create & test)
    2. Reset encoder counts based on limit switches being active (x create & test)
    3. Soft starting when powered up not in home position (create & test)
    4. Calibrate encoder counts for Hazmat Arm positions (tune)
    5. Calibrate encoder counts for Cargo Arm positions (tune)
    6. Limit on voltage ramp rate for driver (create & test)
    7. Add SetNeutralMode() to enable braking instead of coasting (create & test)
