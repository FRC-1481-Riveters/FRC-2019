Intake / Place
	Hatch (I/P)
	Cargo (just place) - two seat motors on the same shaft to pivot - both 
	have encoders



Suction to grab cargo and hatches
	Solenoid to direct vacuum to cargo
	Solenoid to direct vacuum to hatch

	Step 1: Super Suction Arm (SSA)
	2 seat motors with encoders cause the arm to pivot up & down 
	to position placement of the hatch / cargo the solenoid will direct 
	the vacuum to 3 suction cups for the hatch or 1 large
	suction cup for the cargo.

	starting position:
		intake arm folded in, on top of that (starting)
	intake clearing position

	loading positions: 2
		cargo
		hatch
	unloading positions: 4
		cargo 1
		cargo 2
		hatch 1
		hatch 2

	NOTE: Cargo/hatch 3 will be achieved after elevator


	step 2
		inputs: 
			joystick/buttons from controller
				if buttons for arm up/down were used: 
					4 buttons 
					2 for arm to move up/down
					2 for Solenoid, one for hatch, one for Cargo
				if buttons for arm up/down were NOT used:
					2 buttons
						2 for solenoids, same as outlined above
					joystick for arm up/down
			encoders
				say exact position needed for arm
		outputs: the arm moves up or down to set positions, jog to positions,
		vacuums to load/unload hatch and unload cargo
