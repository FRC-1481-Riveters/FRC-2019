Step 1
  mission statement: help the driver to quickly and accurately place a hatch cover or cargo for cargoship. As well as a hatch cover and cargo in rocketship on level 1 and level 2. 
  On the joystick  there will be a button the driver will press to activate the autoassist for the cargoship or rocketship. 
  Auto-assists is programed to align with the white line of the cargoship and rocket for assistantance to achieve attachement of hatch cover or the placement of cargo on level 1. 
  How autoassits  will work  on the field: 
  1. The robot has to be in proximity of // TODO: figure out distance and the placement of the camera  on the robot 
    A. The reflecting tape and the alignment tape will be used to guide the robot  for assistance to driver 
    B. Some of the constraints is the driver may NOT be parallel to the target. It MUST be perpendicular to the target. This target is the reflecting tape and alignment tape on the cargoship and rocketship. However, the rocketship on has reflecting tape on level one, for levels 2 and 3 it is the same basic vision for the first level, yet is  determined by distance ( of the arm, the driver  arrivng in placemet of level one will  be the same placement of the robot for levels 1 and 2)  
  2. If the robot is close to the alignment tape ( when parallel) please press the autoassist button to allow the system to detect the reflecting tape and alignment tape.
    A. The adjustment of the robot will allow the driver to be centered for placement of cargo and hatch cover.
  
Step 2
