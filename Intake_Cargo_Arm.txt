Intake
	Cargo - ground retrival
	Two motors - 
		one to pull in cargo - free spinning 
		one to pivot arm up and down - needs encoder to stop at specific angles

	

	Step 1
		This system has a spinning set of wheels with one motor. 
		It also has two motors   that pivots the arm. 
		This system has an encoder to determine arm angle. 
		The arm is able to assist in climb. 
		It can pull in cargo. 
		there need to be 3 preset positions for arm
			ball intake, climb, and store
		also needs to be able to jog
		has to coordinate with jacks during climb

	Step 2
	List I/O for this system
	Inputs: buttons/joysticks of controller, encoders
	Outputs: cargo pivot arm motors, cargo arm intake motor
