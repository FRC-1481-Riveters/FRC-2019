Step 1 system description:
  The drive subsystem uses the drive motors and the input of the driver joystick to drive the robot forward, backward, left, and right.  
  It includes sensors for the different autoassists. 
  It can also use the encoders to drive certain distances
Step 2 I/O list
  Inputs: joystick to drive, encoders
  Output: drive motors

step 5
driveCommandJoystick
  drive backwards at joystick speed = -1;
  rest= 0;
  drive forward at joystick speed=1;
  drive left at joystick speed= -1;
  rest= 0;
  drive right at  joystick speed= 1;
driveCommandAuton 
  distance =  m
  speed = m/s
  turning = radians
  
  operator interfaces are Joystick and Auton 
  subsystem is drive
  
  step 6
  let forwardReverseSpeed  = driverControllerAxisFrontAndBack 
  let LeftRightSpeed = 0
  let Turning/RotationSpeed = driverControllerAxisRotating
  If ( driveCommandAuton = false ) then 
    driveCommandJoystick ( forwardReverseSpeed, LeftRightSpeed, Turning/RotationSpeed )
   else 
   //driveCommandAuton = true
   driveCommandAuton ( distance, speed, turning )
