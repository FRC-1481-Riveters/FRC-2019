 
Climb jack
	one motor with an encoder

Step 1
The Climb jack has a single motor with an encoder and rotates
in both directions (similar to elevator code from 2018)

Step 2 
List I/O for systems
Inputs: controller buttons/joysticks, encoder
Outputs: motor, action of climb

Step 3

Step 4

Step 5
JackJogExtendCommand
JackJogRetractCommand
jackFullyExtendCommand
JackFullyRetractCommand

Step 6
assumptions:
	enable climb in last 30 seconds of the match, you can have a timer as well 
	the sign convenction as follows
	when jack is extending robot is going up 
	when jack is retracting robot is going down (if not on platform)
	when jack is fully extended JackFullyExtend encoder counts = ClimbJackMaxExtend
	when jack is fully retracted JackFullyRetract encoder  counts = ClimbJackFullyRetracted

JackJogExtendCommand
if (climbJackJogExtendButton is constantly pressed) and (encoder counts are < climbJackJogExtendedLimit) and
(match time left is < 30) then
turn on climbJack_talon to extend jack

JackJogRetractCommand
if (climbJackJogRetractButton is constantly pressed) and (encoder counts are > climbJackJogRetractedLimit) and
(match time left is < 30) then
turn on climbJack_talon to retract jack

JackFullyExtendCommand
if (climbJackFullyExtendButton is pressed once) and (encoder counts are < climbJackMaxExtend) and 
(match time left is < 30) then
turn on climbJack_talon to extend jack all the way

JackFullyRetractCommand
if (climbJackFullyRetractButton is pressed once) and (encoder counts are > ClimbJackFullyRetracted) and
(match time left  is < 30) then
turn on climbJack_talon to retract jack all the way
